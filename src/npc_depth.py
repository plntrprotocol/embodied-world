"""
npc_depth.py — Deep NPC personalities, context-sensitive dialogue, and OWL interaction memory.

NPCs are no longer trait-bags. They have:
- Full psychological profiles (values, fears, desires, secrets)
- Context-sensitive dialogue that responds to world state, relationships, and OWL's history
- Memory of every interaction with OWL — they remember kindness, slights, gifts, conversations
- Mood that shifts based on what's happening
- The ability to initiate conversations, ask for help, offer gifts, share secrets

Design principles:
- Every NPC should feel like a person you could know
- Dialogue should never repeat exactly
- NPCs remember and reference past interactions
- NPCs have inner lives that OWL can discover over time
- The more time you spend with an NPC, the deeper the relationship
