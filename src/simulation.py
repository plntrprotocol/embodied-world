"""
simulation.py — Time, weather, NPC schedules, ecology, seasons, and world update.

The simulation advances time in meaningful chunks. Each "tick" represents
a step forward in the world — time passes, weather shifts, NPCs act, ecology
changes, seasons turn.

Phase 2 additions:
- NPC schedule updates with ~200 NPCs
- Ecology updates (plants, animals, fish)
- Seasonal effects on weather and NPCs
- OWL psychology updates
- Seasonal events
