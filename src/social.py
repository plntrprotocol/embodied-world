"""
social.py — NPC social dynamics: relationships evolve, conflicts arise, alliances form.

This system runs on simulation ticks and updates NPC relationships based on:
- Shared experiences (working together, being in the same place)
- Personality compatibility
- Events that affect multiple NPCs
- Time (relationships naturally drift)
- OWL's actions (mediating, taking sides, etc.)

Design principles:
- Relationships are fluid, not static
- Conflicts emerge from incompatibility, not scripts
- Alliances form around shared interests
- NPCs remember how OWL treats them
- Social change is gradual but meaningful
