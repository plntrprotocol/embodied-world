"""
creative.py — Creative systems: building, crafting, writing, art.

OWL can create things that persist in the world. Creative output is stored
in the database and can be found in locations, shown to NPCs, or simply
exist as part of OWL's life.

Design principles:
- Creative work takes time and energy
- Output persists in the world (a chair in the workshop, a journal on the desk)
- Quality improves with skill and inspiration
- Creative acts affect OWL's psychology (reducing creative_urge, improving mood)
- NPCs can react to OWL's creations
