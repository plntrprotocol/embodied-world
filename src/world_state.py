"""
world_state.py — SQLite schema and world state management.

The world state is the single source of truth for everything in the simulation.
It's stored in SQLite for atomic writes and crash safety, with JSON snapshots
for human readability and git versioning.

Schema design principles:
- Every entity (locations, objects, agents) is a row, not a blob
- State changes are inserts/updates, not replacements
- Timestamps on everything for reconstruction
- WAL mode for crash safety
