"""
narrative.py — Procedural narrative engine.

Weaves events, social dynamics, and world state into emergent stories.
Stories are not scripted — they arise from the interactions of systems.

The narrative engine:
1. Collects recent events and changes
2. Identifies patterns and connections
3. Weaves them into narrative arcs
4. Presents them as stories the player discovers

Story types:
- Personal dramas (NPC relationships, conflicts, joys)
- Community events (celebrations, crises, changes)
- Environmental stories (the village itself changing)
- Mysteries (things that need explaining)

Design principles:
- Stories emerge, they're not told
- The player discovers stories by being present
- Stories have beginnings, middles, and sometimes endings
- Multiple story threads run concurrently
- Stories affect the world and vice versa
